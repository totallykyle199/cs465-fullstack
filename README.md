# Architecture
- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express: is a well-liked server-side Node.js framework for web applications. It supports server logic, middleware, and routing. Express is in charge of managing HTTP requests and providing HTML, JSON, or other content to the client in a full-stack project.  
HTML: (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.  
JavaScript: is a versatile scripting language used for client-side scripting.  
SPA: Single-page HTML applications, or SPAs, load an HTML page and dynamically change the content based on user interactions. They develop responsive and seamless user experiences by utilizing JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, and React. SPAs offer a more seamless user experience by decreasing the need for complete page reloads.
